Introduction
------------

PaySwarm enables people that create digital content such as blog posts, music, 
film, episodic content, photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute 
their creations through their website and receive payment directly from their 
fans and customers. If you have a passion for creating things on the Web, or 
would like to support people doing great things - PaySwarm is for you.

The platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and Web devices 
to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm fixes the problems with rewarding 
people on the web - it reduces and nearly eliminates transactional friction. 
It ensures that the people that you want to support are automatically rewarded 
for their hard work.

We need Web-native payment technology. That is, it is designed to work with how 
the Web works, not how the banks and the credit card companies work. The 
technology can be integrated directly into WordPress-based websites with 
support for Drupal and other content management systems in the works. It has a 
simple, well-defined API, like Twitter, that allows for universal payment on 
the web.

WordPress

This is a WordPress plugin that implements a PaySwarm client. This plugin can

charge a small fee for selected articles that they write.
